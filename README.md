### Description of Project
This project showcases an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for text summarization using a fine-tuned Flan-T5 model. The Flan-T5 model, based on the T5 architecture, has been fine-tuned on a summarization task to generate concise and meaningful summaries from input text.

* Flan-T5 Summarization Model: Leverage the power of the Flan-T5 model for text summarization. This model is fine-tuned for summarization tasks and can generate accurate and coherent summaries.

* Streamlit App: A user-friendly web application built using Streamlit. Users can input text, click a button to trigger summarization, and view the generated summaries.

* Hugging Face Space Deployment: The Streamlit app is deployed on Hugging Face Space, making it easily accessible and shareable. Users can interact with the summarization model without the need for complex setup.
